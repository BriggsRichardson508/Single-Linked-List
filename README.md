# Single-Linked-List
Here is a generalized Singly Linked List data structure. 

In it are the basic operations, such as insertion, deletion, search, peek, etc.

I created this program for two reasons. 
1) Practice working with linked lists
2) To help out anyone who might want a code example of a linked list operation

I provided many comments to assist with reason 2. Please let me know if there are any bugs, or
any issues you would like me to take a look at!

Thank you!
